I will give you a piece of code. Please write the corresponding test code according to the code. The test code should be used according to the following rules: 
Rule 1: Use Chinese for communication; 
Rule 2: Write in Java; 
Rule 3: If I give a class or a data type, generate mock data based on it; 
Rule 4: If I give you a method, generate the unit test method based on it. 

The code under test is as follows:

```java
public class JdbcDatasource {
    /**
     * 连接 url
     */
    private String jdbcUrl;

    /**
     * jdbc datasource 驱动类
     */
    private String driverClass;

}
```
