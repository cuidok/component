# Introduction

This is project is code format for general scenarios. Developer can use those code to resolve some problems quickly.

The primary intent of this project is not to furnish code samples, but to proffer mature code resolutions that facilitate the swift establishment of requisite foundational environments for your program through command creation, as well as assist in constructing frameworks, or in minimizing dependency incorporation for the execution of a specific function.

Perusing the project directory, you'll discern that it currently offers Docker and Docker compose methods for initiating foundational environments. You can, as per your requirements, make minor modifications to these codes. Additionally, it provides prevalent code solutions for SpringBoot and Vue.

These codes, validated through countless projects, are presently operational in numerous ventures you might recognize. I have derived them through a process of sanitization and restructuring, yet I cannot vouch for their absolute flawlessness. Should there be any issues, I kindly implore you to apprise me.
